         The Akshaya Nidhi Scheme is Bindu Jewellery’s way of helping you turn your savings into something precious and enduring. With flexible monthly payments starting from ₹500 or more, customers can steadily accumulate gold in their account, with each month’s value determined by that day’s gold rate. This transparent, fair, and smart approach ensures your investment grows with time.


                          </p>

                  After one year, you are rewarded with a 6% bonus on your total savings — an added sparkle for your dedication. You can then redeem your accumulated gold for jewellery of your choice. This scheme combines the security of saving with the joy of owning fine jewellery, allowing families to plan for special occasions or future needs in a way that’s practical yet deeply rewarding.


                          </p>
